# 🎶 Chinook Database SQL Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is all about exploring the **Chinook Database**, a sample database that looks like a digital music store. It has tables for artists, albums, tracks, genres, customers, employees, and invoices.  

I used **PostgreSQL** to practice SQL queries — starting from simple selections and filtering, and moving towards more advanced business insights like revenue analysis and customer segmentation.
